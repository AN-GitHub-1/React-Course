173. Module Introduction

Will learn how to use React with a backend.



174. How To (Not) Connect To A Database

1. Browser-side code, so JavaScript code running in the browsers should never 
    directly talk to a database (SQL, NoSQL...). This is NOT secure. Database 
    credentials would beb exposed in the browser.

2. It SHOULD talk to a backend app (NodeJS, PHP, ...)



176. Our Starting App & Backend

API or Application Programming Interface. REST API or GraphQL API are the standards.

- REST API
    - Multiple Endpoints (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE...)
    - POST /user {name: 'Max'}
    - Http Verb, Path, and body are changed depending on request type
    - 

- GraphQL API
    - One Endpoint (POST/...)
    - POST /graphql { query: 'query:...' }
    - POST /grapghql part is always the same. Body is changed to submit request

- Both 
    - Typically JSON data is exchanged
    - Any Frontend framework can be used
    - Stateless
    - Method for client -> server communication



177. Sending a GET Request

We use the fetch() feature from JS. Fetch is a promise

What are promises?

Great for doing long processes like downloading images in the background or something.




178. Using async / await

JavaScript promises. Using async / await is an alternative way to avoid using
a lot of then() and catch() blocks with Promises. 

In synchronous operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one is 
completed, the following is unblocked. In other words, you need to wait for a task 
to finish to move to the next one. 

In asynchronous operations, on the other hand, you can move to another task before 
the previous one finishes. This way, with asynchronous programming you’re able to 
deal with multiple requests simultaneously, thus completing more tasks in a much 
shorter period of time.   

So INSIDE a function, it doesn't procede until an "await" call ends but OUTSIDE it,
the program will read other functions and continue. So the async function is saying
"don't wait for me, go on, I'll let you know when I'm finished".



179. Handling Loading & Data States

The isLoading state is used as an example in the code.



180. Handling Http Errors

Http response status codes:

More explained in code.


181. Using useEffect() For Requests

We can use useEffect to automatically load the movies on first load without pressing
the button.

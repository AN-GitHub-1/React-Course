164. What & Why

Most functions in modern React is function based and class-based components can't 
use React Hooks.



165. Adding a First Class-based Component

To use props: 
import { Component } from 'react';

Further notes in User.js

Projects are usually made using only class or function based components.



166. Working with State & Events

Notes in Users.js



167. The Component Lifecycle (Class-based Components Only!)

componentDidMount() is equivalent to  useEffect(..., [])
Called once component mounted (was evaluated and rendered)

componentDidUpdate() is equivalent to useEffect(..., [someValue])
Called once component updated (was evaluted and rendered)

componentWillUnMount() is equivalent to useEffect(()=> { return () => {...}}, [])
Called right before component is unmounted (removed from DOM)



169. Class-based Components & Context

To use context, it's the same process as the function based method but with a Consumer
instead of useContext(). This was covered in a previous lecture. But, the catch is
that with this method a component can only access one context.



170. Class-based vs Functional Components: A Summary

Should I use function or class based?

Use class based if...
1. you're working on an existing project or in a team wher they're getting used
2. you build an 'error boundary' or componentDidCatch()



171. Introducing Error Boundaries

This lifecycle method will be triggered whenever one of the child components throws 
an error.

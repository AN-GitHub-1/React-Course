199. What's So Complex About Forms?

1. Forms and inputs can assume different states.
    - One or more inputs are invalid
        - Output input specific error messages
        - Ensure form can't be submitted
    - All inputs are valid 

2. When to validate?
    - When form is submitted
    - When a input is losing focus
    - On every keystroke



200. Dealing With Form Submission & Getting User Input Values

If you want to log each keystroke use State.

You can also use Ref if you just want the final value.



201. Adding Basic Validation

Anyone can go into the source code and change the javascript.
Basic validation isn't a security mechanism and is there for user experience.



202. Providing Validation Feedback

See code.



203. Handling the "was touched" State

The initial problem is that enteredNameIsValid is set to true. This is a workaround
for not showing the error message by default but is not good code. A solution would
be to set the enteredNameIsValid to false and use an enteredNameTouched in useEffect.



204. React To Lost Focus

At this point, we only validate when the form is submitted and not on losing focus
or on every keystroke. 

onBlur={} in input is when input loses focus. This is built into html.



205. Refactoring & Deriving States

So now we need to validate on each keystroke

187. What are "Custom Hooks"?

They're just functions but functions with stateful logic. Unlike regular functions,
they can use other hooks and states inside it. You can outsource logic used in 
different components with custom hooks. It's just another way to re-use logic like
regular functions.



188. Creating a Custom React Hook Function

Since the code for backwards/forwards are nearly identical, we will make a custom
hook in the hooks folder. Custom hook functions MUST start with "use". The file
name can technically be anything.



189. Using Custom Hooks

Custom components doesn't mean it shares states between components. Each component
receives its own states. So the logic is the only thing that is shared.



190. Configuring Custom Hooks

See code for example. The useCounter now works with an argument an a dependency was
added to the useEffect inside it.



191. Onwards To A More Realistic Example (part 2)

Going to build a custom hook to outsource the http logic.



193. Using the Custom Http Hook



194. Adjusting the Custom Hook Logic (come back to this)

The initial problem with using useEffect() with the fetch() as a dependency is that it
would create an inifinite loop because in the fetch(), or sendRequest() in the useHttp,
there are a few states that change which in-turn re-evalutd the App.js because IT is
using the the custom hook. 

This is because functions are objects in JavaScript. And every time a function is 
recreated even if it contains the same logic, it's a brand new object in memory.



195. Using The Custom Hook In More Components

.bind() binds an object to a functinon. Easy explanaiton here:
